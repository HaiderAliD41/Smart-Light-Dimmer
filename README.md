# Smart Light Dimmer Project

This **Smart Light Dimmer** is a sleek, Wi-Fi-enabled device designed for modern homes. It allows seamless control of lighting intensity via a rotary knob with a built-in LED ring indicator, ensuring precise and user-friendly operation.

## Features

- **Rotary Knob with LED Feedback:** Smooth and intuitive control with real-time brightness indication.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Control lighting through smart home systems or custom applications.
- **Zero-Crossing Dimmer Circuit:** Efficient and flicker-free AC dimming.
- **Compact Design:** Fits standard wall switch enclosures for easy installation.
- **Heat Dissipation:** Ventilation slots to ensure safe and stable operation.

## Enclosure Design

The enclosure is designed to be compact and functional, with dimensions of approximately **70mm (width) x 110mm (height) x 40mm (depth)**, making it compatible with standard electrical gang boxes. It is 3D printable using **SLA resin**, ensuring a durable, heat-resistant build.

## Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller** - Enables Wi-Fi connectivity for remote control.
- **Triac (BT136)** - Handles AC load for dimming.
- **Optocoupler (MOC3021)** - Provides electrical isolation and precise control.
- **HLK-PM01 AC-DC Converter** - Safely converts AC mains to 5V DC.
- **Rotary Encoder** - Provides manual dimming control.
- **3D Printed Enclosure** - Designed with heat-resistant SLA resin for durability and aesthetics.

## 3D Printing

The enclosure is designed for **SLA 3D printers**, ensuring precision and strength. The sleek, matte finish adds a professional touch, making it suitable for any modern smart home setup.

## How It Works

1. Connect the smart light dimmer to a standard gang box using provided screw mounts.
2. Power it with AC mains (110V or 220V).
3. Use the rotary knob for manual dimming or Wi-Fi for remote operation.
4. The LED ring provides feedback on the brightness level, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home.
